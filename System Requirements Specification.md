# System Requirements Specification

## Introduction

### Purpose 

Identify the product whose software requirements are specified in this document, including the revision or release number. Describe the scope of the product that is covered by this SRS, particularly if this SRS describes only part of the system or a single subsystem.

### Document Conventions

Describe any standards or typographical conventions that were followed when writing this SRS, such as fonts or highlighting that have special significance. For example, state whether priorities  for higher-level requirements are assumed to be inherited by detailed requirements, or whether every requirement statement is to have its own priority.

### Intended Audience and Reading Suggestions

Describe the different types of reader that the document is intended for, such as developers, project managers, marketing staff, users, testers, and documentation writers. Describe what the rest of this SRS contains and how it is organized. Suggest a sequence for reading the document, beginning with the overview sections and proceeding through the sections that are most pertinent to each reader type.

### Product Scope

Provide a short description of the software being specified and its purpose, including relevant benefits, objectives, and goals. Relate the software to corporate goals or business strategies. If a separate vision and scope document is available, refer to it rather than duplicating its contents here.

### References

List any other documents or Web addresses to which this SRS refers. These may include user interface style guides, contracts, standards, system requirements specifications, use case documents, or a vision and scope document. Provide enough information so that the reader could access a copy of each reference, including title, author, version number, date, and source or location.

## Overall Description

### Product Perspective

Describe the context and origin of the product being specified in this SRS. For example, state whether this product is a follow-on member of a product family, a replacement for certain existing systems, or a new, self-contained product. If the SRS defines a component of a larger system, relate the requirements of the larger system to the functionality of this software and identify interfaces between the two. A simple diagram that shows the major components of the overall system, subsystem interconnections, and external interfaces can be helpful.

### Product Functions

Summarize the major functions the product must perform or must let the user perform. Details will be provided in Section 3, so only a high level summary (such as a bullet list) is needed here. Organize the functions to make them understandable to any reader of the SRS. A picture of the major groups of related requirements and how they relate, such as a top level data flow diagram or object class diagram, is often effective.

### User Classes and Characteristics

Identify the various user classes that you anticipate will use this product. User classes may be differentiated based on frequency of use, subset of product functions used, technical expertise, security or privilege levels, educational level, or experience. Describe the pertinent characteristics of each user class. Certain requirements may pertain only to certain user classes. Distinguish the most important user classes for this product from those who are less important to satisfy.

### Operating Environment

Describe the environment in which the software will operate, including the hardware platform, operating system and versions, and any other software components or applications with which it must peacefully coexist.

### Design and Implementation Constraints

Describe any items or issues that will limit the options available to the developers. These might include: corporate or regulatory policies; hardware limitations (timing requirements, memory requirements); interfaces to other applications; specific technologies, tools, and databases to be used; parallel operations; language requirements; communications protocols; security considerations; design conventions or programming standards (for example, if the customerâ€™s organization will be responsible for maintaining the delivered software).

### User Documentation

List the user documentation components (such as user manuals, on-line help, and tutorials) that will be delivered along with the software. Identify any known user documentation delivery formats or standards.

### Assumptions and Dependencies

List any assumed factors (as opposed to known facts) that could affect the requirements stated in the SRS. These could include third-party or commercial components that you plan to use, issues around the development or operating environment, or constraints. The project could be affected if these assumptions are incorrect, are not shared, or change. Also identify any dependencies the project has on external factors, such as software components that you intend to reuse from another project, unless they are already documented elsewhere (for example, in the vision and scope document or the project plan).

## External Interface Requirements

### User Interfaces

Describe the logical characteristics of each interface between the software product and the users. This may include sample screen images, any GUI standards or product family style guides that are to be followed, screen layout constraints, standard buttons and functions (e.g., help) that will appear on every screen, keyboard shortcuts, error message display standards, and so on. Define the software components for which a user interface is needed. Details of the user interface design should be documented in a separate user interface specification.

### Hardware Interfaces

Describe the logical and physical characteristics of each interface between the software product and the hardware components of the system. This may include the supported device types, the nature of the data and control interactions between the software and the hardware, and communication protocols to be used.

### Software Interfaces

Describe the connections between this product and other specific software components (name and version), including databases, operating systems, tools, libraries, and integrated commercial components. Identify the data items or messages coming into the system and going out and describe the purpose of each. Describe the services needed and the nature of communications. Refer to documents that describe detailed application programming interface protocols. Identify data that will be shared across software components. If the data sharing mechanism must be implemented in a specific way (for example, use of a global data area in a multitasking operating system), specify this as an implementation constraint.

### Communications Interfaces

Describe the requirements associated with any communications functions required by this product, including e-mail, web browser, network server communications protocols, electronic forms, and so on. Define any pertinent message formatting. Identify any communication standards that will be used, such as FTP or HTTP. Specify any communication security or encryption issues, data transfer rates, and synchronization mechanisms.





## System Features

This template illustrates organizing the functional requirements for the product by system features, the major services provided by the product. You may prefer to organize this section by use case, mode of operation, user class, object class, functional hierarchy, or combinations of these, whatever makes the most logical sense for your product.

### Log Drinks

Users will record the drinks they consume throughout the day.

#### 4.1.1	Description and Priority

Users will record their consumption of water throughout the day manually by choosing from three different categories: a "drink", a "glass", or a "bottle". A drink constitutes 4 oz of water, a glass constitutes 
8 oz of water, and a bottle constitutes 16 oz of water. This features is critical to the overal usability of the system, so it is of high priority.

#### 4.1.2	Stimulus/Response Sequences

1. From the main screen, the three TapWater water consumption sizes are presented and selectable.
2. The user will select one of the option when they have drank a matching amount of water.
3. The total amount of water consumed in that day will increment on the screen
4. A new drink with be added to the device's database

#### 4.1.3	Functional Requirements

- TBD:

### View Drink History

Users will view the drinks they have recorded.

#### 4.2.1	Description and Priority

Users will have a list of all their previously recorded drinks. This list will contain the size of the drink logged as well as the time it was logged. This feature is a high priority.

#### 4.2.2	Stimulus/Response Sequences

1. The user will select an icon on the main screen which will lead them to their drink history.
2. Users will see a list of all the previous drinks they have recorded as well as information regarding the size of the drink and time it was recorded.

#### 4.2.3	Functional Requirements

- TBD:

### Schedule Drink Notifications

Users will be able to schedule the frequency in which they are reminded by the system to drink water.

#### 4.3.1	Description and Priority

The system will allow for both manual, unassisted drink entry as well as remind the users that it is time for them to consume another drink of a certain size in order to meet their self-defined goal. 
This goal is user defined and the user will specify how often (or how many times per 24 hour period) they would like to be reminded to drink. The priority of this feature is medium.

#### 4.3.2	Stimulus/Response Sequences

1. User will manually be able to edit from the main screen.
2. User will enter they goal number of ounces to drink per 24 hour period, and then specify how many times daily they'd like to receive a notification.
3. The system will calculate as the day goes on how many ounces to remind the user to drink based on what the user has already logged. Based on the time, notifications will fire accordingly throughout the day containing the number calculated by the system.

#### 4.3.3	Functional Requirements

- TBD:

### User Registration/Login/Log Out

Users will register a unique account using their email address and a user-defined password, and log in and out of this account as they wish.

#### 4.4.1	Description and Priority

Users will have a list of all their previously recorded drinks. This list will contain the size of the drink logged as well as the time it was logged. This feature is a medium priority.

#### 4.4.2	Stimulus/Response Sequences

### Synchronization

Users will sync their data with the system's server in order to be up-to-date between devices.

#### 4.5.1	Description and Priority

Users will be able to pull down on the history screen, which will synchronize their drink history with the history recorded for the user on the server. This feature is of low importance.

#### 4.5.2	Stimulus/Response Sequences

1. User will view their drink history.
2. User will pull down on the screen in order to trigger the synchronization feature.
3. The system will post the drinks in the history to the server, and the server will respond with the current history between devices for that user.

#### 4.5.3	Functional Requirements

- TBD:



## Other Nonfunctional Requirements

### Performance Requirements

Performance issues are not expected form TapWater.
Simplicity is a fundamental element of the design.

Performance will vary depending upon device and system version.

Changing between screens and processing button presses will be handled by the built in features of the SDK for the given mobile device and should perform at device expectations.

Sycnhronization time may vary depending on network connectivity.
The data exchanged should be optimized to assure the fastest synchronization possible.
A local cache of drinks will be kept by the system so that it does not have to load data from the server repeatedly.

### Safety Requirements

Use of the system should not present any harm to the user's device.

TapWater should not be used while operating a motor vehicle or any other kind of dangerous machinery.

Users should not use TapWater to consume more than a healthy amount of water.
What is considered a "healthy" amount of water varies from person to person. 
If a user is uncertain they should seek the advice of a doctor.

Users should not use TapWater if they have a condition in which water consumption may damage their health.

### Security Requirements

The drink data is not sensetive information.
It is still private user information and should be secured using standard database security protocols.

The system communicates usernames, passwords, and device information over the network.
This communication should be encrytpted with an HTTPS connection.
Additionally, the database should not store plain text user passwords.

Specify any requirements regarding security or privacy issues surrounding use of the product or protection of the data used or created by the product. Define any user identity authentication requirements. Refer to any external policies or regulations containing security issues that affect the product. Define any security or privacy certifications that must be satisfied.

### Software Quality Attributes

The user interfaces should be appealing to the eye.
The system should follow a consistent design style with a consistent color scheme.

The mobile applications should be available on their respective software marketplaces.
The iOS app should be available on the Apple App store.
The Android app should be available on the Google Play store.

The data synchronized to each of a user's devices should be consistent with the data on the other devices.
