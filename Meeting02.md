## Development Check-in

In the week leading up to this meeting minimal development activity took place.

Kon-Kon got rails installed and running.

## Critical Path Management Document

We created a rough Critical Path Management Document from the activity table Jonathan made.
This week Jonathan will go back and create a formal activity table and critical path diagram to present at the next meeting.

## System Requirements Specification

The group was supposed to create a SRS document at this meeting but the task turned out to be too large to be completed in one sitting.
Instead the sections were broken up and different parts were assigned to each person to complete in the week leading up to the next meeting.
