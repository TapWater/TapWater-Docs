# Configuration Management System

The TapWater application makes use of Git/Github as its configuration management system.

Git is a very popular and dependable version control system that allows for frequent revisions to be made to our files on Github's server, 
while also providing peace-of-mind that if any change is damaging, it is always possible to revert to previous versions.

Github is the server used to store files and configurations related to TapWater. With Github, there is no cost to host repositories for TapWater's purposes, and group 
collaboration is very simple.
