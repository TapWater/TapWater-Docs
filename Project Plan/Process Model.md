# Process Model

We chose the Extreme Programming (XP) process model.

We chose the XP model because we have a small team working on a project with a simple design.
The XP's focus on simplicity would help us focus on keeping he design simple.
Since the team all attend the same university having regular srcrums was very feasible.
