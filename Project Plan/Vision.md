The purpose of the TapWater Application is to help people who need to monitor their water consumption.
It can help atheletes and people with medical conditions that demand they drink a certain amount of water every day.

One of the major gripes about dieting or other apps that track water consumption is how difficult it is to enter data.
Navigating to the screen to enter water is often difficult
After the user reaches the screen, they are usually asked to enter an amount in ounces.
Sometimes it can be hard to guess how many ounces of water you've had to drink.
TapWater seeks to solve this problem by making it easy and straightforward to enter water consumption.

TapWater gives the uses set amounts of water they can log.
The amounts relate to real world objects, so it is easy for the user to gauge how much water they wish to log.
The interface is simple, clean, and easy to understand.
